# Resolving Tickets in osTicket

We will go through the lifecycle of a ticket from intake to resolution within the open-source help desk ticketing system osTicket.

## Lifecycle Stages

In this instance, an End user/customer has reported an issue. The customer will login to the Help Desk portal and create a Ticket from this link http://localhost/osTicket and open a new ticket. Users will have to enter Contact information and a Help topic as to what is going on. From that point, the User will have to report the issue as best as they can with as much information that is most helpful and then they will create the Support Ticket.
