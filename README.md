# Resolving Tickets in osTicket

We will go through the lifecycle of a ticket from intake to resolution within the open-source help desk ticketing system osTicket.

## Lifecycle Stages

In this instance, an End user/customer has reported an issue. The customer will login to the Help Desk portal and create a Ticket from this link http://localhost/osTicket and open a new ticket. Users will have to enter Contact information and a Help topic as to what is going on. From that point, the User will have to report the issue as best as they can with as much information that is most helpful and then they will create the Support Ticket.

Here we are using one of our end user info we created to create a ticket

Now we will log in as A Help Desk agent named James. We will navigate to http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php and login and from there, We will observe the ticket's properties, by Priority/Department/SLA/and who it was assigned to. From the Tickets, we will navigate to open tickets. Navigate to priority and also the SLA plan, take a glance at the comments, and depending on the severity of the comments the user inputs, possibly you may want to reach out to the customer to actually gauge the issue.
